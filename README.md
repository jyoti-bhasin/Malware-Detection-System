A Machine Learning based Malware Detection System to detect and
determine the presence of malware on a system and whether it is malicious or
not.

Malware Detection System is a subpart of Intrusion Detection System which is
used to detect and determine the presence of malware on a system or to
distinguish whether a specific program(or dataset or set of files) is malicious or
safe. It follows the process of scanning the computer and files to detect
malware. 

Algorithms used-
1. ExtraTreesClassifier,
2. RandomForestClassifier

Applications-
Malware is one of the most serious security threats and in the digital era, it is
spreading more due to vulnerabilities in the system or carelessness of users.
In order to protect a computer from damage or remove malware from a
compromised computer system, it is essential to accurately detect malware.
But determining whether a given program contains malware is generally
undecidable and complex at times.
